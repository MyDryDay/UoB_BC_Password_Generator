# UoB_BC_Password_Generator

# Introduction
This piece of work was styled after a client request; all of the HTML and CSS was complete, all i needed to do was right the necessary JavaScript to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters which utilized lower case & upper case letters, numbers and special characters. The script needed to include prompts for the user to decide how long their password should be and which character sets it should be composed of.

## Why did i do this?
To solidify my learning up until this point. I needed to utilize variables & manipulate the data stored in them, functions & declaring them when necessary, DOM, events & event handling, and object methods.
I wanted to see if i could utilize what i had learned to create something useful, something tangible.

### What i learnt
I learnt a great deal about JavaScript in general; best practice, DOM, object methods, and events. 
I also researched a fair bit about unicode, utf-8 and character sets as this was initially how i wanted to generate my character lists to be used in generating the passwords. However, i could not get these pieces of code to work and decided on another method which was easier for me to understand.

#### For the future
Instead of having prompts for the user that appear as pop-ups, i'd like to change the application to have a series of check boxes to decide on the parameters of the passwords generated.
I'd also like to alter the way the app checks the length of the password, as it is now it will ask the length and if you would like each of the character sets and only then will it tell you if you have selected a number that isn't supported. I'd like to change this so it checks & tells you if the password length isn't supported immediatley after entering it and then goes through the rest of the prompts.
Additionaly, as of now the passwords generated aren't guaranteed to have at least one of each character set chosen in them, i'd like to alter the script so that if a parameter is chose there is a 100% guarantee that a character from that set appears in the password.
